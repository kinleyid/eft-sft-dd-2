<h3>Interpretation of results:</h3>
Episodic memory refers to recall of richly detailed events in the personal past, while semantic memory refers to factual knowledge. This distinction exists in the context of future thinking as well: episodic future thinking involves imagining the personal future in rich detail, while semantic future thinking refers to factual knowledge as it pertains to the future. It is well-established that episodic future thinking can motivate farsighted decisions, and while it is usually assumed that semantic future thinking cannot have the same effect, this has never been tested. The goal of this study is to test the assumption that future thinking must be episodic in order to motivate future-oriented decision-making.
<h3>Hypothesis and Main Question:</h3>
The goal of this study is to test whether factual knowledge about the future, like imagination of personal future events, can motivate us toward future-oriented decision-making. We hypothesize that it can, but that its effect will be weaker than imagination of personal future events.
<h3>Why is this important to study?</h3>
This study will increase the body of research on this topic and add to our understanding of how memory and reward areas in the brain interact.</br>
